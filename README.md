# RPL SimPy Simulator

## Overview
The RPL SimPy Simulator is a powerful tool designed to simulate the behavior of RPL (Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks) in network environments. It generates networks, displays them, and creates DIOs (DODAG Information Objects) and DAOs (Destination Advertisement Objects) to facilitate DODAG (Destination Oriented Directed Acyclic Graph) creation.

## Features
- **Network Generation**: The simulator can generate a variety of network topologies to test the performance of RPL under different conditions.
- **Network Display**: Visualize the generated networks to better understand their structure and the path of data flow.
- **DIO and DAO Creation**: The simulator creates DIOs and DAOs, essential components in RPL for the creation and maintenance of DODAGs.

## Getting Started
1. **Installation**: Provide instructions on how to install and set up the simulator.
2. **Usage**: Provide instructions on how to use the simulator, including how to generate networks, create DIOs and DAOs, and visualize the networks.
